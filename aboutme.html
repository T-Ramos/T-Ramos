            Hello everyone! My name is Travis Ramos and I am excited to start this immersive program with you all here at DigitalCrafts. I am a complete beginner at coding, so bare with me!
        </p>
        
    <h3>Why I Joined</h3>
   
        <p>
            I graduated college last May from Sam Houston State University with a doulbe major in Economics and International Business. Upon graduating, I started a health and fitness business called <a href ="https://healthhitters.com">Health Hitters</a>, where we focus on helping others achieve their desired goals through strength training.

    <h4>Reason 1</h4>
        
        <p>
            Part of owning a business is having a responsive website. I threw our website together using Wordpress. It was pretty hard at first, but after a few tutorial videos I managed to create a decent cite without using any code. There is still a lot of work I would like to do to our cite and this would require me to understand how to write code!
        </p>
    
    <h4>Reason 2</h4>
        
        <p>
            Another reason I joined DigitalCrafts is because I have always been very interested in developing, I just didn't know where to start. While I was in college, computer science wasn't offered until I was already half way through so I decided not to change my major. This led me to discovering DigitalCrafts!
